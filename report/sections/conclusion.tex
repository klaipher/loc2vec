\subsection{Summary of Contributions}

This report presented a comprehensive implementation and evaluation of the Loc2Vec approach for learning location embeddings using triplet-loss networks, specifically adapted for Kyiv city data. Our work makes several significant contributions to the field of geographical machine learning and location-based services.

\subsubsection{Primary Contributions}

\textbf{Successful Regional Adaptation}: We successfully adapted the Loc2Vec methodology to Ukrainian geographical data, demonstrating that location embedding approaches can be effectively transferred to regions with distinct urban characteristics, including Soviet-era urban planning and Eastern European architectural patterns.

\textbf{Comprehensive Transfer Learning Evaluation}: Our systematic comparison of EfficientNet, ResNet, and MobileNetv3 architectures represents the first comprehensive evaluation of modern CNN architectures for geographical representation learning. The results show that transfer learning provides substantial improvements (4.4\% in triplet accuracy, 8.4\% in venue mapping) while reducing training time by 35-40\%.

\textbf{Methodological Framework**: We developed a robust framework for processing OpenStreetMap data into multi-channel geographical representations and established evaluation protocols that can be applied to other cities and regions.

\textbf{Practical Performance**: Our best model (EfficientNet-B0) achieved 68.7\% venue mapping accuracy, representing a 49.9\% improvement over distance-based baselines, demonstrating clear practical value for location-based applications.

\subsubsection{Technical Achievements}

\textbf{Multi-channel Representation}: The 12-channel geographical representation effectively captured complex urban patterns, with road networks and land use information proving most critical for performance.

\textbf{Training Efficiency**: Transfer learning approaches converged significantly faster than training from scratch while achieving better generalization across different urban districts.

\textbf{Mobile Deployment Viability**: MobileNetv3-based models demonstrated that real-time venue mapping on mobile devices is feasible with acceptable accuracy-efficiency trade-offs.

\textbf{Semantic Understanding**: Qualitative analysis revealed that learned embeddings successfully captured semantic relationships between geographical areas, correctly clustering culturally and functionally similar locations.

\subsection{Answers to Research Questions}

Our work addressed several key research questions in geographical machine learning:

\textbf{Q1: Can Loc2Vec be effectively adapted to Eastern European urban environments?}
Yes, our results demonstrate successful adaptation to Kyiv's unique geographical characteristics, achieving strong performance across diverse urban districts with different development patterns.

\textbf{Q2: How do modern CNN architectures compare for location embedding tasks?}
EfficientNet-B0 provided the best overall performance, ResNet-50 showed strong accuracy but higher computational cost, and MobileNetv3 offered the best efficiency while maintaining competitive accuracy. All transfer learning approaches significantly outperformed training from scratch.

\textbf{Q3: What are the computational trade-offs for mobile deployment?}
MobileNetv3 achieved 112ms latency on mobile hardware while maintaining 65.8\% venue mapping accuracy, making real-time mobile deployment feasible. EfficientNet requires 168ms but provides 68.7\% accuracy for high-end devices.

\textbf{Q4: How do learned embeddings capture urban semantic structure?}
The embeddings successfully captured multi-scale urban patterns, from local building configurations to district-level functional zoning, as demonstrated through visualization and nearest neighbor analysis.
