\subsection{Key Findings and Insights}

Our comprehensive evaluation of the Loc2Vec approach for Kyiv city yielded several important findings that advance the understanding of location embeddings and transfer learning for geographical data.

\subsubsection{Effectiveness of Location Embeddings for Urban Understanding}

The successful adaptation of Loc2Vec to Kyiv demonstrates that location embeddings can effectively capture the semantic structure of urban environments, even in regions with distinct geographical and cultural characteristics. Our results show that:

\textbf{Semantic Coherence}: The learned embeddings successfully captured meaningful relationships between geographical areas. For example, the clustering of cultural sites around Maidan Nezalezhnosti and the grouping of recreational areas demonstrates that the model learned to understand urban functional zoning.

\textbf{Multi-scale Understanding}: The 12-channel representation effectively captured information at multiple scales, from local building patterns to district-level land use characteristics. This is evidenced by the strong performance across different venue types and urban densities.

\textbf{Cultural and Historical Context}: Unlike many previous studies focused on Western urban patterns, our work demonstrates that location embedding approaches can adapt to Soviet-era urban planning and Eastern European architectural characteristics.

\subsubsection{Transfer Learning Advantages}

Our systematic comparison of transfer learning approaches revealed significant advantages over training from scratch:

\textbf{Improved Accuracy}: All transfer learning approaches outperformed the base CNN, with EfficientNet-B0 achieving a 4.4\% improvement in triplet accuracy and 8.4\% improvement in venue mapping accuracy.

\textbf{Training Efficiency}: Transfer learning models converged 35-40\% faster than training from scratch, reducing computational requirements and enabling more rapid experimentation.

\textbf{Better Generalization}: Transfer learning models showed improved generalization across different districts of Kyiv, suggesting that pre-trained features provide useful inductive biases for geographical understanding.

\textbf{Robustness**: Transfer learning models demonstrated better handling of challenging cases such as boundary areas and sparse rural regions.

\subsubsection{Architecture-Specific Insights}

Our evaluation revealed distinct characteristics of different CNN architectures for location embedding:

\textbf{EfficientNet-B0}:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Best overall performance across all metrics
    \item Excellent balance of accuracy and computational efficiency
    \item Strong feature reuse from ImageNet pre-training
    \item Suitable for both research and production deployment
\end{itemize}

\textbf{ResNet-50}:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Strong feature extraction capabilities
    \item Good performance but higher computational cost
    \item More prone to overfitting without careful regularization

\end{itemize}

\subsection{Implications for Geographical Machine Learning}

\subsubsection{Methodological Contributions}

Our work provides several methodological insights for the geographical machine learning community:

\textbf{Multi-channel Representation}: The 12-channel geographical representation proved effective for capturing complex urban patterns. The channel ablation studies revealed that road networks and land use information are most critical, while amenity and historical features provide important semantic context.

\textbf{Transfer Learning Strategy**: The progressive unfreezing strategy proved most effective, suggesting that geographical features benefit from gradual adaptation of pre-trained weights rather than aggressive fine-tuning.

\textbf{Evaluation Framework}: Our comprehensive evaluation framework, including both quantitative metrics and qualitative analysis, provides a template for future location embedding research.

\subsubsection{Practical Applications}

The results have immediate practical implications for location-based services:

\textbf{Venue Mapping**: The 49.9\% improvement over distance-based baselines demonstrates clear commercial value for navigation and recommendation systems.

\textbf{Urban Planning**: The semantic understanding of urban areas could inform city planning decisions and zoning analysis.

\textbf{Mobile Applications**: The mobile-optimized models (particularly MobileNetv3) enable real-time venue mapping on smartphones with acceptable accuracy.

\textbf{Regional Adaptation**: The successful adaptation to Kyiv demonstrates that location embedding approaches can be transferred to new geographical regions with appropriate data processing.

\subsection{Limitations and Challenges}

\subsubsection{Data-Related Limitations}

Several limitations stem from our data sources and processing approach:

\textbf{OpenStreetMap Coverage**: While OSM coverage for Kyiv is comprehensive, some newer developments and rural areas have incomplete data, affecting model performance in these regions.

\textbf{Temporal Dynamics**: Our static approach doesn't capture temporal variations in venue usage or seasonal changes in land use patterns.

\textbf{Scale Limitations**: The fixed 500m radius and 256Ã—256 pixel resolution represent trade-offs that may not be optimal for all venue types or urban densities.

\textbf{Labeling Challenges**: Semantic labeling of geographical areas is inherently subjective, and our automated labeling approach may not capture all nuances of urban functionality.

\subsubsection{Model-Related Limitations}

\textbf{Computational Requirements**: Despite optimizations, the models require significant computational resources for training, potentially limiting accessibility for smaller research groups.

\textbf{Interpretability**: The learned embeddings, while effective, remain relatively opaque, making it difficult to understand exactly which geographical features drive similarity decisions.

\textbf{Generalization Boundaries**: While transfer learning improved generalization within Kyiv, it's unclear how well these models would transfer to cities with significantly different urban characteristics.

\textbf{Fine-grained Distinctions**: The models still struggle with fine-grained distinctions between similar venue types, particularly in dense commercial areas.

\subsubsection{Evaluation Limitations}

\textbf{Ground Truth**: Venue mapping evaluation relies on OSM venue labels, which may contain errors or be outdated.

\textbf{Semantic Evaluation**: Evaluating semantic similarity is challenging and our approaches, while systematic, represent one perspective on geographical similarity.

\textbf{Real-world Testing**: Our evaluation is primarily based on retrospective analysis; real-world deployment testing would provide additional insights.
