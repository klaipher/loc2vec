\section{Further Steps}
\label{sec:further_steps}

This section outlines potential improvements, future research directions, and broader applications of our Loc2Vec implementation for Kyiv city, along with identified limitations and suggested solutions.

\subsection{Technical Improvements}

\subsubsection{Architecture Enhancements}

Looking back at our work, there are several architectural improvements that could make our embeddings even better. One idea we're excited about is implementing multi-scale feature fusion using feature pyramid networks. This would let us capture information at different spatial scales at the same time - think of it like being able to see both the forest and the trees simultaneously, which could really improve how we understand both local patterns and city-wide relationships.

We're also curious about adding attention mechanisms - basically spatial attention layers that would help the model focus on the most important geographical features for each location. This could be especially useful for distinguishing between areas that look similar but have subtle differences.

Another direction we want to explore is graph neural networks, which would explicitly model the spatial relationships between neighboring areas. This feels like a natural fit for geographical data since locations are inherently connected to their neighbors. We're also intrigued by vision transformers (ViTs) for spatial data - they might be better at capturing long-range spatial dependencies than traditional CNNs.

\subsubsection{Training Methodology Advances}

\textbf{Contrastive Learning:} Implementing more sophisticated contrastive learning techniques such as SimCLR or SwAV, which might provide better self-supervised signals than triplet loss alone.

\textbf{Progressive Training:} Developing curriculum learning strategies that gradually increase the complexity of spatial relationships learned by the model.
